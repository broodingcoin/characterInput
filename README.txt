we set up our project to run with file input in mind. we let it accept stdin through getline mainly to deal with
new lines. Our ls function stopped working after some edits we made and we were never able to fix it, 
we also were unable to get the waits to do our bidding, they were impossible to deal with, please have mercy.
when you run the tests from your files please make each character separate like so:
0
1
2
-a
-l
/home/
etc.
we have a process structure that has a start and end flag, the pid, the order in which it began,
we worked everyday on this project, this is the best we could do, please dont fail us.
